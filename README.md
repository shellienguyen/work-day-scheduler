About:
------
This page provides the user with a daily work scheduler to keep track of tasks by the hour.

Project Goal:
-------------
To provide the user with a daily scheduler that keeps tracks of work tasks during the work hours
of 7AM-5PM.  Time blocks are by the hour and color coded to show: the past time blocks in gray,
the current time block in coral, and the future time blocks in green.  The user can click on
any time block to input a new task or update an existing task.  Persistency is done with the use of
localStorage to allow the reloading of the tasks when the page reloads or a new window opens.
